## Problem

<sub>This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool)</sub>


Given the pointer to the head node of a doubly linked list, reverse the order of the nodes in place. That is, change the *next* and *prev* pointers of the nodes so that the direction of the list is reversed. Return a reference to the head node of the reversed list. 

**Note:** The head node might be NULL to indicate that the list is empty.  

**Function Description**

Complete the _reverse_ function in the editor below.  

reverse has the following parameter(s):

- *DoublyLinkedListNode head*: a reference to the head of a DoublyLinkedList  

Returns  
- *DoublyLinkedListNode*: a reference to the head of the reversed list  

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer $t$, the number of test cases.  

Each test case is of the following format:

-  The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of elements in the linked list.  
-  The next $n$ lines contain an integer each denoting an element of the linked list.

**Constraints**

- $1 \le t \le 10$  
- $0 \le n \le 1000$  
- $0 \le DoublyLinkedListNode.data \le 1000$   

**Output Format**

Return a reference to the head of your reversed list.  The provided code will print the reverse array as a one line of space-separated integers for each test case.

```py


#
# Complete the 'reverse' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_DOUBLY_LINKED_LIST.
# The function accepts INTEGER_DOUBLY_LINKED_LIST llist as parameter.
#

#
# For your reference:
#
# DoublyLinkedListNode:
#     int data
#     DoublyLinkedListNode next
#     DoublyLinkedListNode prev
#
#

def reverse(llist):
    if llist is None:
        return None

    current = llist
    temp = None

    while current:
        # Swap next and prev
        temp = current.prev
        current.prev = current.next
        current.next = temp

        # Move to the original next node
        current = current.prev

    # Return the new head
    if temp:
        return temp.prev

    return llist


```
