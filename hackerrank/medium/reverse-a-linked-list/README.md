# Reverse a linked list

## Problem

<sub>This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool) and is accompanied by a video lesson.</sub>

Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the <code>next</code> pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.  

**Example**  
$head$ references the list $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow NULL$  

Manipulate the $next$ pointers of each node in place and return $head$, now referencing the head of the list $3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow NULL$.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the *reverse* function in the editor below.  

*reverse* has the following parameter:  

- *SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head:*  a reference to the head of a list  

**Returns**  

- *SinglyLinkedListNode pointer:*  a reference to the head of the reversed list  
 

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer $t$, the number of test cases.  

Each test case has the following format:  

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of elements in the linked list.  
Each of the next $n$ lines contains an integer, the $data$ values of the elements in the linked list.  

**Constraints**

- $1 \le t \le 10$  
- $1 \le n \le 1000$  
- $1 \le list[i] \le 1000$, where $list[i]$ is the $i^{th}$ element in the list.


**Output Format**

```py


#
# Complete the 'reverse' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_SINGLY_LINKED_LIST.
# The function accepts INTEGER_SINGLY_LINKED_LIST llist as parameter.
#

#
# For your reference:
#
# SinglyLinkedListNode:
#     int data
#     SinglyLinkedListNode next
#
#

def reverse(llist):
    prev = None
    current = llist

    while current:
        next_node = current.next   # save next node
        current.next = prev        # reverse pointer
        prev = current             # move prev forward
        current = next_node        # move current forward

    return prev


```
