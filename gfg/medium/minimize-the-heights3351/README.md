# Minimize the Heights II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  denoting heights of  **n**  towers and a positive integer  **k**.

For  **each** tower, you must perform  **exactly one**  of the following operations  **exactly once**.

- Increase the height of the tower by k
- Decrease the height of the tower by k

Find out the  **minimum** possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
 **Note:**  It is  **compulsory** to increase or decrease the height by k for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should  **not**  contain any  **negative integers**.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The array can be modified as [1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k] = [3, 3, 6, 8]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.

```

```
Input: k = 3, arr[] = [3, 9, 12, 16, 20]
Output: 11
Explanation: The array can be modified as [3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k] = [6, 12, 9, 13, 17]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11. 

```

 **Constraints** 
1 ≤ k ≤ 107
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMinDiff(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        int ans = arr[n - 1] - arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // Height cannot become negative
            if (arr[i] - k < 0)
                continue;

            int mini = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k);
            int maxi = max(arr[i - 1] + k, arr[n - 1] - k);

            ans = min(ans, maxi - mini);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
