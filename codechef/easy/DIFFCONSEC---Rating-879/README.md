## Problem

### Different Consecutive Characters

Chef has a binary string $S$ of length $N$. Chef can perform the following operation on $S$:

- Insert any character ($0$ or $1$) at any position in $S$.

Find the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that no two consecutive characters are same in $S$.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ — the length of the binary string $S$.
- The second line of each test case contains a binary string $S$ of length $N$ containing $0$s and $1$s only.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform so that no two consecutive characters are same in $S$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \le N \le 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
2
11
4
0101
5
00100

```

```
1
0
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  We can perform the following operations: $11 \rightarrow 1\underline{0}1$.

 **Test case 2:**  We do not need to perform any operations.

 **Test case 3:**  We can perform the following operations: $00100 \rightarrow 0\underline{1}0100 \rightarrow 01010\underline{1}0$.

```py
def solve():
    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()

        count = 0

        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                count += 1

        print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
