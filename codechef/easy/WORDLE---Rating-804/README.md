## Problem

### Wordle

Chef invented a modified wordle.

There is a hidden word $S$ and a guess word $T$, both of length $5$.

Chef defines a string $M$ to determine the correctness of the guess word. For the $i^{th}$ index:

- If the guess at the $i^{th}$ index is correct, the $i^{th}$ character of $M$ is $\texttt{G}$.
- If the guess at the $i^{th}$ index is wrong, the $i^{th}$ character of $M$ is $\texttt{B}$.

Given the hidden word $S$ and guess $T$, determine string $M$.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of two lines of input.
- First line contains the string $S$ - the hidden word.
- Second line contains the string $T$ - the guess word.
### Output Format

For each test case, print the value of string $M$.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings $\texttt{BgBgB}$, $\texttt{BGBGB}$, $\texttt{bgbGB}$ and $\texttt{bgbgb}$ will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $|S| = |T| = 5$
- $S, T$ contain uppercase english alphabets only.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
ABCDE
EDCBA
ROUND
RINGS
START
STUNT

```

```
BBGBB
GBBBB
GGBBG

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Given string $S = \texttt{ABCDE}$ and $T = \texttt{EDCBA}$. The string $M$ is:

- Comparing the first indices, $\texttt{A} \neq \texttt{E}$, thus, $M[1] = \texttt{B}$.
- Comparing the second indices, $\texttt{B} \neq \texttt{D}$, thus, $M[2] = \texttt{B}$.
- Comparing the third indices, $\texttt{C} = \texttt{C}$, thus, $M[3] = \texttt{G}$.
- Comparing the fourth indices, $\texttt{D} \neq \texttt{B}$, thus, $M[4] = \texttt{B}$.
- Comparing the fifth indices, $\texttt{E} \neq \texttt{A}$, thus, $M[5] = \texttt{B}$. Thus, $M = \texttt{BBGBB}$.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Given string $S = \texttt{ROUND}$ and $T = \texttt{RINGS}$. The string $M$ is:

- Comparing the first indices, $\texttt{R} = \texttt{R}$, thus, $M[1] = \texttt{G}$.
- Comparing the second indices, $\texttt{O} \neq \texttt{I}$, thus, $M[2] = \texttt{B}$.
- Comparing the third indices, $\texttt{U} \neq \texttt{N}$, thus, $M[3] = \texttt{B}$.
- Comparing the fourth indices, $\texttt{N} \neq \texttt{G}$, thus, $M[4] = \texttt{B}$.
- Comparing the fifth indices, $\texttt{D} \neq \texttt{S}$, thus, $M[5] = \texttt{B}$. Thus, $M = \texttt{GBBBB}$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    string s;
	    cin>>s;
	    string T;
	    cin>>T;
	    
	    string m="";
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(s[i]==T[i]){
                m+="G";
            }else{
                m+="B";
            }
        }
	    
	    cout<<m<<endl;
	    
	}

}

```
