# Palindrome Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `x`, return `true` *if* `x` *is a   palindrome , and* `false` *otherwise*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        
        // Negative numbers or numbers ending in 0 (except 0)
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
            return false;
        }

        int reversedHalf = 0;

        while (x > reversedHalf) {
            reversedHalf = reversedHalf * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        return x == reversedHalf || x == reversedHalf / 10;
    }
}
```
