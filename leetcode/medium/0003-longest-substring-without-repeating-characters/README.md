# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the  **longest**   **substring**  without duplicate characters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_set<char>mp;
        int maxLong=0;
        int start=0;

        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){

            while(mp.find(s[i])!=mp.end()){
                mp.erase(s[start]);
                start++;
            }

            mp.insert(s[i]);        

            maxLong=max(maxLong,i-start+1);
        }
        return maxLong;
    }
};

```
